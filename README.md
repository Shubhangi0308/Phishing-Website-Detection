# Phishing-Website-Detection
#### Build a web application to detect whether the website is phished or Legitimate. For this, I had used CNN-LSTM Algorithm, text feature generation process (TF-IDF technique), and XGBoost classification, which was mainly used to specify the probability of phishing. This application determines whether the URL is from a phished website or a legitimate website.
